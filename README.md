## 📌 Featured Projects
📊 **Kalman Filter-Based Pairs Trading**  
Designed a dynamic statistical arbitrage strategy using Kalman Filters to model time-varying hedge ratios in cointegrated Consumer Staples stock pairs.  
⚙ *Python, pykalman, statsmodels, Yahoo Finance API*  
📈 *Sharpe Ratio 1.26, Max Drawdown -3.5%, CAGR 6.7% (2022–2024 OOS)*

🔍 **Fraud Detection with Machine Learning**  
Built and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network) on a highly imbalanced dataset (~0.8% fraud rate). Prioritised recall and AUC for rare event detection.  
⚙ *Python, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost*  
📈 *Neural Network achieved 97.5% recall and AUC of 0.9964*

💡 **Transparent Credit Scoring with Explainable ML**  
Developed an interpretable credit scoring model using SHAP to explain Random Forest predictions.  
⚙ *Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP*  
📈 *~80% accuracy, Macro F1-score 0.79; generated actionable insights on key financial indicators*
